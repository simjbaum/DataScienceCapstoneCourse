# Data Science Capstone code for the Data Science Specialization in R programming language

In this work I created a word prediction algorithm based on a n-gram model. This was implemented on a R shiny app. The app is available under this link: 

In a nutshell the algorithm processes the users input and searches within a pre-processed n-gram dictionary for the next word to add. The dictionary was build of a public data set containing > 20 million words gathered from blogs, twitter and news articles.
